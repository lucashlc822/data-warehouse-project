# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!** ðŸš€
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.
A modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modelling, and analytics.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Architecture** - Designing a data warehouse using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers).
2. **ETL Pipelines** - Extracting, Transforming, and Loading structured data into the Warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling** - Developing interconnected fact and dimension tables using the **Star Schema Data Model**, optimizing for querying and advanced analytics.
4. **Analytics & Reporting** - Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## Project Requirements

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## Data Architecture 
The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Multi-hop Architecture), which consists of the **bronze**, **silver**, and **gold** layers. This type of structure involves making incremental improvements to the data quality as it flows through each layer of the architecture. The setup for this project is shown below:
![Data Architecture](documents/data_architecture.png)

**Bronze Layer:** ðŸ¥‰
- The raw data is stored as-is from the source systems.
- Data is extracted from the CSV files (source object type) into the SQL Server database.

**Silver Layer:** ðŸ¥ˆ
- Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes.
- Preparation phase prior to data analysis.

**Gold Layer:** ðŸ¥‡
- Holds all of the business-ready data modelled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.

## Data Flow
![Data Flow Diagram](documents/data_flow_diagram.png)

The diagram above shows the path the data takes moving from the source folder to the gold layer, where business-ready data can be used for visualization and analysis. Note that most of the rearrangement occurs between the silver and gold layers, where the data model is created through fact/dimension categorization and grouping. More on this topic below.

## Data Integration
![Data Integration Diagram](documents/data_integration.png)

The diagram above shows all the relationships discovered between the data tables. The tables in the CRM group can be tied to the tables in the ERP group (e.g., the *prd_key* column from the *crm_prd_info* has a close relationship to the *id* column from the *erp_px_cat_g1v2* table).

## Data Model
![Data Mart Diagram](documents/data_model.png)

As shown from the **Star Schema Model**, the data is separated into two dimension groups (customers and products tables) and one fact group (sales table). A **surrogate key** is used for each of the dimension tables. These tables have a **one-to-many relationship** with the master fact table (gold.fact_sales).
